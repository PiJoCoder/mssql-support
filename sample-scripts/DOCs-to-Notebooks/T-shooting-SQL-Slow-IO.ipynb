                "Performance monitor counters are used to determine slow I/O performance. These counters measure how fast the I/O subsystem services each I/O request on average in terms of clock time. The specific [Performance monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/perfmon) counters that measure I/O latency in Windows are `Avg Disk sec/ Read`, `Avg. Disk sec/Write`, and `Avg. Disk sec/Transfer` (cumulative of both reads and writes).\r\n",
                "\r\n",
                "In SQL Server, things work the same way. Commonly, you look at whether SQL Server reports any I/O bottlenecks measured in clock time (milliseconds). SQL Server makes I/O requests to the OS by calling the Win32 functions such as `WriteFile()`, `ReadFile()`, `WriteFileGather()`, and `ReadFileScatter()`. When it posts an I/O request, SQL Server times the request and reports the duration of the request using [wait types](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-os-wait-stats-transact-sql). SQL Server uses wait types to indicate I/O waits at different places in the product. The I/O related waits are:\r\n",

                "> To provide context and perspective, in the world of troubleshooting SQL Server, CSS has observed cases where an I/O request took over one second and as high as 15 seconds per transfer-such I/O systems need optimization. Conversely, CSS has seen systems where the throughput is below one millisecond/transfer. With today's SSD/NVMe technology, advertised throughput rates range in tens of microseconds per transfer. Therefore, the 10-15 millisecond/transfer figure is a very approximate threshold we selected based on collective experience between Windows and SQL Server engineers over the years. Usually, when numbers go beyond this approximate threshold, SQL Server users start seeing latency in their workloads and report them. Ultimately, the expected throughput of an I/O subsystem is defined by the manufacturer, model, configuration, workload, and potentially multiple other factors.\r\n",

Transaction log writes are sequential writes while reading or writing data from a data file is random. Mixing data and log files on one drive volume (especially conventional spinning disk drives) will cause excessive disk head movement.\r\n",

If you don't explicitly begin a transaction, any insert, delete, or update will result in a transaction (we call this auto transaction). If you do 1,000 inserts in a loop, there will be 1,000 transactions generated. Each transaction in this example needs to commit, which results in a transaction log flush and 1,000 transaction flushes. When possible, group individual update, delete, or insert into a bigger transaction to reduce transaction log flushes and [increase performance](https://docs.microsoft.com/troubleshoot/sql/admin/logging-data-storage-algorithms#increasing-performance).

If there were issues with thread scheduling (for example, high CPU), both the Log Writer thread and log flushes could get delayed. In SQL Server 2016, up to four Log Writer threads were added to increase the log-writing throughput. See [SQL 2016 - It Just Runs Faster: Multiple Log Writer Workers](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/sql-server-support/sql-2016-it-just-runs-faster-multiple-log-writer-workers/ba-p/318732). In SQL Server 2019, up to eight Log Writer threads were added, which improves throughput even more. Also, in SQL Server 2019, each regular worker thread can do log writes directly instead of posting to the Log writer thread. With these improvements, `WRITELOG` waits would rarely be triggered by scheduling issues.\r\n",
